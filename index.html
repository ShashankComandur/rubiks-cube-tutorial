<p> Corner pieces have 3 colors, middle pieces have 2, and center pieces have one. In the diagram above, the piece labeled "1" is a corner piece - it has 3 colors: blue, red and white. The piece labeled "2" is a middle piece - it has 2 colors: orange and blue. The piece labeled "3" is a center piece - it only has one color, in this case it is green. An important thing to note is that no matter how you twist or turn the cube, the center pieces will never move - they will always stay the same color.
